## Introduction

Welcome to the README file of our small database project developed during the 4th semester at DHBW (Duale Hochschule Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg). This project was created as part of our database lecture, where we applied database principles to design and implement a PostgreSQL database.

## Project Description

Our project focuses on developing a small database system using PostgreSQL. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our understanding of fundamental database concepts and their practical implementation. Throughout the development process, we have applied various principles and techniques to ensure the efficiency and reliability of our database.Our sample database represents the game  Overwatch.

## Features

- PostgreSQL database: We have utilized the PostgreSQL relational database management system as the foundation of our project.
- Data modeling: We have designed a suitable database schema to represent the entities, relationships, and attributes of our domain.
- SQL queries: We have implemented a set of SQL queries to retrieve and manage data stored in the database.
- Data integrity: We have enforced integrity constraints to maintain the consistency and accuracy of the data.

## Getting Started

To get started with our project, please follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install PostgreSQL if you haven't already.
3. Create a new PostgreSQL database using the provided schema in the 'create.sql' file.
4. Import the necessary data into the database via the 'insert.sql' file.
5. Execute the SQL queries included in the project to interact with the database, you can find the in the 'queries.sql' file.

## Conclusion

We are proud to present our small database project developed during our 4th semester at DHBW. This project has allowed us to apply the principles of database management and gain practical experience with PostgreSQL. We hope you find our project informative and useful. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to us.
